# Basic of Visualization Data
Basic data visualization and communication in data analytics refers to the ability to depict and present information from data in graphical forms that are easy to understand. It involves using charts, graphs, tables, and other data visualization tools to communicate findings or patterns discovered in data in a clear and effective manner. The goal is to make complex information more understandable and digestible to diverse audiences.

### 4 Reasons use Chart
## 1. Comparison
Comparison is the process of examining two or more things to determine their differences, similarities, or relationships. In the context of data analytics, comparison can be done between various metrics, variables, or data groups to gain a better understanding of existing patterns or trends.

## 4. Spatial
"Spatial" refers to the concept or property associated with space or physical location in a specific context. In data analysis, the spatial concept often relates to geographic data or data related to geographic locations.
Example: 
- Map

# DATA VISUALIZATION USING PHYTON
Data visualization using Python is the process of visualizing data using various libraries and tools available in the Python programming environment. Data visualization is a way to present information and patterns in data through graphical representations, such as charts, plots, maps, and more. The goal of data visualization is to clarify and communicate information in an easily understandable and engaging manner.

Some commonly used libraries for performing data visualization in Python include:

Matplotlib: It is the most popular and versatile library for data visualization in Python. Matplotlib provides various types of plots such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.

Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a higher-level interface for creating more aesthetically pleasing and complex plots. Seaborn is suitable for statistical data exploration and visualization.

Plotly: It is a powerful library for creating interactive plots and data visualization. Plotly supports various types of plots and interactivity that can be integrated with various platforms.

# RESPONSIBLE ANALYTICS PRACTICES
## Data Privacy Laws and Best Practices
Data privacy laws are regulations that govern how organizations collect, store, use, and share personal data. These laws are designed to protect individuals' privacy rights and ensure that their personal information is handled responsibly.
### GDPR
(General Data Protection Regulation) GDPR is a European Union regulation that governs the protection of individuals' personal data within the EU. It grants rights to individuals to control their personal data and imposes obligations on organizations collecting, storing, and processing such data. GDPR emphasizes transparency, consent, and data security.
### FERPA
(Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) FERPA is a federal law in the United States that protects the privacy and security of students' education records. It grants rights to parents or eligible students to access and control their education information. FERPA also regulates the disclosure of education information and provides privacy protections for students.
### HIPAA
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) HIPAA is a federal law in the United States that regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Its goal is to protect the privacy and security of patients' health information. HIPAA gives patients rights to control their health information and establishes security standards for healthcare organizations handling PHI.
### IRB
(Institutional Review Board) IRB is an independent body tasked with reviewing, approving, and overseeing research involving human subjects. Its purpose is to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of research subjects. IRB ensures that research is conducted in accordance with relevant ethics and security standards.
### PCI
(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) PCI DSS is a security standard that governs the processing, storage, and transmission of payment card data. Developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, this standard is designed to protect payment card information from unauthorized access and misuse. Organizations that accept credit card payments must comply with PCI DSS to ensure the security of payment card transactions.

## Best Practices for Responsible Data Handling
Best practices for responsible data handling ensure that organizations manage data in a secure, ethical, and compliant manner, respecting individuals' privacy rights.
### Handling PII
Handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII): This refers to information that can be used to identify a specific individual. Examples include full names, home addresses, identification numbers, phone numbers, or any other information that can directly or indirectly identify a person. Handling PII involves processes of collecting, storing, using, and disposing of such information while ensuring individual security and privacy.
### Securing Data
Data Security Measures: This involves steps and practices to protect data from unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion. Data security measures include encryption, the use of strong passwords, appropriate access controls, activity monitoring, and implementing strict security policies.
### Anonymity Protection
Anonymity Protection: This means removing or obfuscating identifying information in data to protect individuals' privacy. Anonymization is done to prevent the identification of specific individuals within a dataset. Anonymization techniques include removing or modifying personal information so that individuals cannot be identified.
### Balancing Interpretability and Accuracy
Balancing Interpretability and Accuracy: This relates to the dilemma that arises when attempting to produce data that is anonymous while maintaining the necessary level of accuracy for analysis and interpretation of useful data. Sometimes, increasing anonymity can decrease the accuracy of the data analysis and insights derived from it, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to find the right balance between these two aspects.
### Shortcomings of Population-level Generalizations with Limited Sample Data
Shortcomings of Population-level Generalizations with Limited Sample Data: This indicates that generalizing from limited sample data may not always reflect the full variation or complexity of the larger population. In research or data analysis contexts, it's important to be aware of the limitations of the sample data used and avoid making exaggerated conclusions about the population based on limited data.

## Types of bias that affect cellection and interpretation of data
### Confirmation Bias
This bias occurs when individuals actively seek out or interpret information in a way that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. It can lead to the selective collection or interpretation of data that supports one's viewpoint while disregarding evidence that contradicts it.
### Human Cognitive Bias
This encompasses a wide range of biases that arise from the way human brains process information. Examples include anchoring bias (relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered), availability bias (placing greater importance on information readily available), and recency bias (giving more weight to recent events or experiences).
### Motivational Bias
Motivational bias occurs when individuals consciously or unconsciously manipulate data collection or interpretation to serve their personal or professional interests. This bias can stem from financial incentives, career advancement goals, or personal beliefs.
### Sampling Bias
Sampling bias occurs when the sample used in data collection is not representative of the population of interest. This can happen if certain groups are systematically excluded or underrepresented in the sample, leading to skewed results that do not accurately reflect the broader population.
### Selection Bias in Visualizations/Data Representations
This bias can occur when certain visualizations or data representations are chosen to support a particular narrative or agenda, while ignoring or downplaying alternative perspectives. For example, selecting only specific data points or visualizations that highlight a desired outcome, while omitting others that provide a more balanced view.
