# Basic of Visualization Data
Basic data visualization and communication in data analytics refers to the ability to depict and present information from data in graphical forms that are easy to understand. It involves using charts, graphs, tables, and other data visualization tools to communicate findings or patterns discovered in data in a clear and effective manner. The goal is to make complex information more understandable and digestible to diverse audiences.

### 4 Reasons use Chart
## 1. Comparison
Comparison is the process of examining two or more things to determine their differences, similarities, or relationships. In the context of data analytics, comparison can be done between various metrics, variables, or data groups to gain a better understanding of existing patterns or trends.
Example:
- Bar Chart Vertical

- Bar Chart Horizontal

- Line Chart

- Multiple line Chart

## 2. Composition
Composition refers to the arrangement or combination of various elements or parts that form a whole. In the context of data analytics or data visualization, composition is often used to describe how a whole is made up of or divided into smaller parts.
Example:
- Pie Chart

- Tree Map Chart

### Comparison & Composition
Example:
- Stacked Bar Chart

- Stacked 100% Bar Chart

## 3. Relationship
In data visualization, "relationship" refers to the correlation or association between two or more variables or dimensions. It encompasses the methods for exploring and displaying dependencies, connections, or patterns that may exist among various elements in the data.
Example:
- Scatter Plot

## 4. Spatial
"Spatial" refers to the concept or property associated with space or physical location in a specific context. In data analysis, the spatial concept often relates to geographic data or data related to geographic locations.
Example: 
- Map

# DATA VISUALIZATION USING PHYTON
Data visualization using Python is the process of visualizing data using various libraries and tools available in the Python programming environment. Data visualization is a way to present information and patterns in data through graphical representations, such as charts, plots, maps, and more. The goal of data visualization is to clarify and communicate information in an easily understandable and engaging manner.

Some commonly used libraries for performing data visualization in Python include:

Matplotlib: It is the most popular and versatile library for data visualization in Python. Matplotlib provides various types of plots such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more.

Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a higher-level interface for creating more aesthetically pleasing and complex plots. Seaborn is suitable for statistical data exploration and visualization.

Plotly: It is a powerful library for creating interactive plots and data visualization. Plotly supports various types of plots and interactivity that can be integrated with various platforms.

Folium: It is a library for creating interactive maps using geographic data. Folium allows you to add markers, polygons, and other interactions to maps.

Pandas Visualization: It is an integrated data visualization module within the Pandas library. Pandas has methods for creating plots directly from its DataFrame and Series objects.

Altair: It is a declarative library that allows for deep visualization with simple and intuitive syntax.

Through these libraries, Python users can create informative, engaging, and often interactive data visualizations to explore and understand data better. With data visualization, users can identify patterns, trends, anomalies, and other insights that may be hidden in the data.

## Using Seaborn
Seaborn is a library for creating graphs and statistics using Python. This library is built based on the existing Matplotlib library. Then integrated with the data structure in Pandas.

## Histogram
A histogram is a graphical display of frequency tabulation depicted with bar graphics as a manifestation of data binning. Each bar display shows the proportion of frequencies in each series of adjacent categories with non-overlapping intervals.

# CRISP-DM
CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. It is a popular process workflow method in data science for addressing data mining or data analysis projects.

CRISP-DM consists of six main stages:
- Business Understanding: This stage involves understanding the business objectives and requirements from a business perspective. It involves identifying the business problem or opportunity to be addressed through data analysis.
- Data Understanding: This stage involves gathering relevant data for analysis. It includes data collection, data cleaning, exploration, and understanding.
- Data Preparation: This stage involves processing and preparing data for further analysis. It includes feature selection, further data cleaning, data transformation, and forming datasets ready for modeling.
- Modeling: This stage involves building and evaluating potential data mining models. It includes selecting appropriate models, training models on available data, tuning model parameters, and evaluating models to ensure quality and performance.
- Evaluation: This stage involves evaluating the results of the model and data analysis to ensure that the solutions produced meet business objectives and user needs. It also involves assessing model performance and identifying necessary improvement steps.
- Deployment: This final stage involves deploying the generated models and solutions into operational environments. It includes implementing models, further testing, and integrating solutions into existing business processes or systems.

CRISP-DM is a flexible and adaptable framework that can be used in various data analysis projects. It helps organize and manage the data analysis workflow from start to finish, ensuring project success and effective use of data to support decision-making.
